Yanlin Liu (Russell) is currently a PhD Student under supervison of [Prof.Bi Kaiming](https://www.polyu.edu.hk/cee/~kaimbi/) at Departmant of Civil and Environmental Engineering in [Hongkong Polyutechnic University](https://www.polyu.edu.hk/). 

During both my undergraduate and graduate studies, I have concentrated on research in wind engineering. As an undergraduate, I studied the impact of turbulence intensity on unsteady gust loading on a rectangular cylinder, with the results published in the Journal of Wind Engineering and Industrial Aerodynamics. During my Masterâ€™s studies, I have further developed my expertise in wind load modeling and structural response analysis, particularly focusing on the visual comfort impact of vortex-induced vibrations on long-span suspension bridges. I developed a framework to assess visual comfort, which was published in the Journal of Performance of Constructed Facilities. Additionally, I have gained substantial experience in computational fluid dynamics simulations and structural analysis using tools such as MATLAB, Python, and ANSYS.
