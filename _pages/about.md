Yanlin Liu (Russell) is currently a PhD Student under supervison of [Prof. Bi Kaiming](https://www.polyu.edu.hk/cee/~kaimbi/) at Departmant of Civil and Environmental Engineering in [Hongkong Polyutechnic University](https://www.polyu.edu.hk/). My primary research focuses on the Extreme hazard resilience assessment of Transmission tower clusters in the Hong Kong region. To date, I have published 2 research papers, obtained 1 invention patent, and registered 1 software copyright.

During my master’s studies, I worked under the supervision of [Prof. Rujin Ma](https://bridge.tongji.edu.cn/5f/cf/c14928a155599/page.htm) at Bridge Design Method and Progress of Tongji University. My research encompassed optimization of design wind loads for Long-span suspension bridges, fatigue performance analysis of steel truss bridge joint plates, and vision-based evaluation of vortex-induced vibration comfort for long-span bridges.

During my undergraduate studies, I investigated the influencing mechanisms of aerodynamic admittance on bluff body cross-sections under the guidance of [Prof. Shaopeng Li](https://civil.cqu.edu.cn/info/1322/16399.htm), and completed my bachelor’s thesis under the supervision of [Prof. Xi Tu](https://civil.cqu.edu.cn/info/1323/12532.htm).
