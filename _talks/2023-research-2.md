Visual comfort; Long-span suspension bridge; Vortex-induced Vibration

The framework: Firstly, it is imperative to initially establish the finite element model and obtain the modal frequencies and modal shapes of the bridge through dynamic analysis. Subsequently, the simulated driver's visual range under different speeds should be determined, followed by establishing the visual mapping relationship to generate the simulated driving videos. These videos will be utilized in crafting a comprehensive questionnaire, which will be distributed to gather evaluative feedback on parameters associated with visual comfort. The final step is to carry out data analysis to identify the maximum allowable VIV amplitude that can be tolerated from the aspect of visual comfort.

Fig.1 Flowchart of the evaluation process for visual comfort.  
The visual simulation is conducted based on the principles of human vision imaging. The human vision imaging principle involves simulating a camera to capture the planar image of an object. It is an idealized and linear model that disregards external interferences. By employing coordinate system transformations, spatial point coordinates can be transformed into planar point coordinates, enabling the acquisition of geometric characteristics of the bridge pavement using necessary by mathematical formulas.

Fig.2 The establishment of Visual comfort simulation method.  
The visual comfort of driving on bridges under VIV is an objectively existing phenomenon based on individual subjective perception. This study intends to use questionnaire surveys to assess the visual perception of driving under bridge vibrations.

Fig.3 The process of questionnaire.  
To ensure the scientific and reliability of the questionnaire survey results, a reliability analysis was conducted for the survey results. The reliability analysis focuses on internal consistency, which examines the degree of consistency among the survey results of the same type of questionnaire items.  
A suspension bridge with main span of 2180m is taken as an example to study the driving visual comfort of long-span suspension bridge under VIV. Due to the unavailability of direct presentation of simulation videos in this paper, key frames are extracted from typical working conditions videos to illustrate the impact of various parameters on the driver's visual comfort during driving. These typical conditions include a single-vehicle crossing the entire bridge, as well as variations in parameters such as VIV amplitudes, driving speeds, and vertical VIV modes.

Fig.4 The examples of mode effects on visual comfort.  
To ensure the driver's visual comfort and driving safety when the VIV of the main girder occurs in vertical bending, the visual comfort of the high-order modes should meet the requirements, and the limit value of the VIV of the main girder should be controlled at 0.2m~0.3m.

Fig.5 Comfort evaluation under different amplitude limits (Blue: more than Six; Red: lower than Six).  
The VIV amplitudes and the visual comfort limits calculated based on this case study varying with VIV frequency, according to different standards. The VIV limit curves prescribed by different code show the similar trend. The VIV limits specified by code in the low-frequency range are higher than the visual comfort-based limits proposed base on this case study. When considering the VIV limits for long-span suspension bridge structures, it is necessary to specify more stringent vibration limits based on visual comfort.
