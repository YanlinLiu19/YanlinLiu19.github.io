Wind tunnel test; Benchmark; Turbulence; 3D AAF


In this project, I mainly carried out wind tunnel test, formal analysis, writing – original draft, preparation. Under the guidance of Prof. Shaopeng Li, I completed the whole process from learning basic theory, wind tunnel test, data analysis and paper writing.

Based on the three-dimensional spectral theory, the effects of the turbulence intensity on the unsteady aerodynamic behavior of gust loading on a 5:1 rectangular cylinder are investigated through wind tunnel tests. Three types of grids are used to produce the turbulent flow fields with different turbulence intensities and approximately unchanged turbulence integral scale, providing the experimental basis for this work in Fig.1.  
The spanwise correlation of the surface pressures also increases with the turbulence intensity for the sectional model with B/D = 5 in Fig.2. Concerning the lift force, it is necessary to consider the influence of turbulence intensity on the spatial distribution of gust loading. An increase in turbulence intensity amplifies the three-dimensional aerodynamic effects of turbulence, resulting in a more correlated lift force than the vertical wind fluctuations.  
The research of this work illustrates that turbulence intensity plays a dominant role in determining the 3D one-wavenumber AAF of the lift force. It is observed that an increase in turbulence intensity attenuates the 3D one-wavenumber AAF in Fig.3. The 2D AAF of the lift force acting on a 5:1 rectangular cylinder is experimentally confirmed to be independent of the turbulence intensity, consistent with the classic aerodynamic theory.

It is necessary to take into account the effect of turbulence intensity in estimating the AAF of a 5:1 rectangular cylinder. The one- and two-wavenumber spanwise correction factors directly demonstrate the mechanism of the three-dimensional aerodynamic effect of turbulence, which can be regarded as a low-pass filter that retains the energy of low-frequency and attenuates the higher frequency energy. An increase in turbulence intensity filters small-scale vortices in the spanwise direction, resulting in the domination of large-scale vortices characterized by the lower frequency components. Consequently, the stronger spanwise correlation of lift force can be revealed from an energy point of view when the turbulence intensity increases. The results show that a decrease in turbulence intensity amplifies the filtered bandwidth in the spanwise direction, suggesting that the large-scale vortices in the separated flow are contaminated by the smaller eddies.
