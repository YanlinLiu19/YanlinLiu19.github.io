Fig. 1 First vertical mode of the 2300m suspension bridge (Zhang-Jing-Gao).  
This research establishes the finite element model of the 2300m suspension bridge through the finite element software ANSYS, then makes the nonlinear static analysis and the large deformation of prestressed modal analysis to verify the effectiveness and practicability of the model through the first 50 modes.  
At the same time, improved harmonic synthesis method is adopted to simulate the three-dimensional fluctuating wind field near the long-span suspension bridge, Wind speed power spectrum and correlation are tested.

Secondly, the frequency-domain and time-domain analysis methods of bridge buffeting response are used respectively, which shows that the self-excited force will reduce the buffeting response of the structure, and the time-domain analysis is more accurate and effective.

Fig. 4 Displacement spectrum of frequency domain analysis  
The time-domain method of parameter analysis illustrates that the aerodynamic admittance to the structure of buffeting response of vertical and horizontal amplitude have significantly lower, but for the torsional buffeting response of the impact is not high, also find that the structure of the bridge buffeting displacement response haves a non-linear positive correlation with the wind speed, and buffeting response increase with the increase of the roughness height. The close correlation between aerodynamic admittance, wind field parameters and buffeting response was verified.
