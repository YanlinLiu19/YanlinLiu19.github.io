Reynolds number ; Wind tunnel test ; 5:1 Rectangular Cylinder


This project was carried out under the guidance of Prof. Shaopeng Li from Chongqing University. My main work in the project was to analyze the experimental data of the wind tunnel section model through MATLAB, write the fitting code to find the spanwise coherence function curve and obtain the relevant trend of the experiment.

(a) Mean of the pressure coefficients

(b) Phase difference of fluctuating pressure coefficients

In brief, the mean suction peak is approximately upstream of the vortex center, and the root mean square (RMS) of the fluctuating pressure attains its peak value in the forward area of the reattachment point. In contrast, the phase-reversal and minimum of the chordwise correlation of pressures occur near the core position of the main vortex. These relationships provide us with a possible means of estimating the time-averaged flow topology through the pressure characteristics, which are easily measured in traditional wind tunnel tests instead of the flow visualization.  
The content of this part is to determine the effect of Reynolds number on the position of the vortex through the wind pressure characteristics.

(b)The measured 3D one-wavenumber AAF of lift force

The second part is to explore the law of Reynolds number on three-dimensional aerodynamic admittance. From the figure, we can get that the spectra of the lift changes obviously with Reynolds number, but the law of 3D one-wavenumber AAF is more chaotic, especially in the high-frequency region. According to our experimental expectation at that time, the 3D one-wavenumber AAF should have obvious regularity, while the two-wavenumber AAF should form a consistency that does not change with Reynolds number.
