Wind Engineering ; Wind tunnel test

Wind tunnel tests and 5:1 cross-section model.
An increase in the turbulence intensity results in a stronger spanwise correlation of the fluctuating pressures on the side surfaces. 
The correlation of wind is higher than that of force.
It is confirmed that the 2D AAF depends only on the cross-sectional shape rather than the turbulence intensity.
